//Work in pairs!
//Partner A checks out the project “PairConversions” from GitHub (zip, not clone).
//Partner A will then share the project on their GitHub with partner
// B. Partner B will now clone the project from partner A. Now A and B each create a
// local branch and pick one of the two sets of instructions (in the project), implement them.
//Merge when you are done and review your partners’ code.
