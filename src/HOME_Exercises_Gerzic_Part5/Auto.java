//The class should have the following methods:

//- getters and setters (methods) for each attribute.
//- a method called "gasGeben(double geschw)", which takes a double as a
//parameter and increases the speed of the car by this value.
//- a method named "braking(double speed)", which takes a double as a parameter and increases the speed of the car by this value.

//- a method called "toString()", which returns a string representation of the car

//Create a main class called "AutoTest" that creates two instances of the class
//"Auto", sets its attributes and tests its methods by calling them and outputting the results.

//For example, the main class might create an "Auto" object named "auto1" with
//the following attributes:
//- Make: "Toyota"
//- Model: "Camry
//- Year: 2018
//- Speed: 0
//Test these methods of the class Auto in the main method in the class
//AtuoTest. (This is only for running the program and testing the functions
//of the class Recipe)
//For example, you could use the method "gasGeben()" for "auto1" with a parameter of
//100.0 and the method "toString()" for "auto1" could be called to output the result in the console.
